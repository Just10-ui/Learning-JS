/*
  * Variables = Data Containers
  * JavaScript variables are containers for data.
  * JavaScript variables can be declared in 4 ways:

  * Modern JS
  - Using let
  - Using const

  * Older JS
  - Using var (Not Recommended)
  - Automatically (Not Recommended)
*/

// Example: using let
let name = 'Justin'; // - The name variable contains (or stores) the value "Justin"

// Example: using const
const age = 22;

// Example: using var 
var gender = 'Male'; // !(Not Recommended)

// Example: declaring automatically 
x = 1; // !(Not Recommended)

/*
  * Variables are labels for data values.
  * Variables are containers for storing data.
*/

/*
  * JavaScript Identifiers
  * Variables are identified with unique names called identifiers.
  * Names can be short like x, y, z.
  * Names can be descriptive age, sum, carName.

  * The rules for constructing names (identifiers) are:

  - Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
  - Names must begin with a letter, a $ sign or an underscore (_).
  - Names are case sensitive (X is different from x).
  - Reserved words (JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names.

  ! Note
  - Numbers are not allowed as the first character in names.
  - This way JavaScript can easily distinguish identifiers from numbers.
  - It's a good programming practice to declare all variables at the beginning of a script.
*/

// Example: declaring many variable with one statement
let fName = 'Justin', 
lName = 'Apolong', 
mName = 'Pajares';

// - Note: Always use const if the value is unchanging or constant
