/*
  * Operators are for Mathematical and Logical Computations
  - The Assignment Operator = assigns values
  - The Addition Operator + adds values
  - The Multiplication Operator * multiplies values
  - The Comparison Operator > compares values
*/

// Example of using assignment operator
let x = 10; // - Assign the value of 10 to x

// Example of using addition operator
let y = 3;
let z = x + y; // - Note: if you use addition operator in string, it wil concatonate the strings

  * Types of JavaScript Operators
  * There are different types of JavaScript operators:
  - Arithmetic Operators
  - Assignment Operators
  - Comparison Operators
  - Logical Operators

  ? Arithmetic Operators

  * Operator      	  Description
  -     +	      |      Addition
  -     -	      |      Subtraction
  -     *	      |      Multiplication
  -     **	    |      Exponentiation
  -     /       |    	 Division
  -     %	      |      Modulus (Division Remainder)
  -     ++	    |      Increment
  -     --	    |      Decrement

  * Operator   	     Example	       Same As
  -    =	     |     x = y	   |     x = y
  -    +=	     |     x += y	   |     x = x + y
  -    -=	     |     x -= y	   |     x = x - y
  -    *=	     |     x *= y	   |     x = x * y
  -    /=	     |     x /= y	   |     x = x / y
  -    %=	     |     x %= y	   |     x = x % y
  -    **=     |     x **= y	 |     x = x ** y

  ? Comparison Operators

  * Operator      Description	                            Example
  -    ==	    |   equal to	                         |    x == 5
  -    ===	  |   equal value and equal type	       |    x === 5
  -    !=	    |   not equal	                         |    x != 5
  -    !==	  |   not equal value or not equal type	 |    x !== 5
  -    >	    |   greater than	                     |    x > 5
  -    <	    |   less than	                         |    x < 5
  -    >=	    |   greater than or equal to	         |    x >= 5
  -    <=	    |   less than or equal to	             |    x <= 5

  ? Logical Operator

  * Operator     	    Description
  -     &&	    |     logical and
  -     ||	    |     logical or
  -     !	      |     logical not
